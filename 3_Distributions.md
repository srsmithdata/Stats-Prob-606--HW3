# Chapter 3: Distributions of Random Variables

## Assignments

### Homework

*OpenIntro Statistics*

* Practice: 3.1 (see `normalPlot`), 3.3, 3.17 (use `qqnormsim` from lab 3), 3.21, 3.37, 3.41
* Graded: 3.2 (see `normalPlot`), 3.4, 3.18 (use `qqnormsim` from lab 3), 3.22, 3.38, 3.42

### Lab

The labs are available in the `IS606` R package. To start the first lab, use the `startLab` function. This will copy the lab to your current working directory and rename the file according to your computer username (as returend by `Sys.info()['user']`). If this is incorrect, then either provide the `file-prefix` parameter to `startLab`, or rename the file after it has been copied.


```r
IS606::startLab('Lab3')
```
